Paper – E
Students in a class are given a scholarship to follow a diploma course. Students are selected from the marks obtained from an aptitude test. 50%of the students with the highest marks are eligible for this scholarship.

 

Assume there are 10 students in the class and write a python program to enter the marks of all the students and display the marks of the students who have selected for the scholarship. Save the program as 2E.py.

 

Complete the below pseudo code of the insertion sort algorithm which sort numbers in ascending order and use it in your program.

 

    INSERTION_SORT(A)

    for k =  ____________ to n

            key = A[k]

            i = k - 1

            while  i > 0 and A[i] > key

                     A[i + 1]  = A[i]

                     i  =  i  -1

            A[i + 1] = key

 

 

Upload the program to the courseweb link “DSA_2E-<center>_<Group>”
